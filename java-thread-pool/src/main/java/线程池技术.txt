TODO. 使用线程池化技术来提升系统性能
Thread Pool creates new threads as needed, reuse previously threads when available.
If no existing thread is available, a new thread will be created and added to the pool.

1. 线程池利用重用线程(线程缓存)提升性能，避免线程的创建和销毁
2. 提高响应的速度，无需等待线程创建完成再执行
3. 提供线程统一分配和调控，只需关注执行具体task任务上

TODO. 线程池中线程的五种状态
RUNNING:  Accept new tasks and process queued tasks
SHUTDOWN: Don't accept new tasks, but process queued tasks
STOP:     Don't accept new tasks, don't process queued tasks, and interrupt in-progress tasks
TIDYING:  All tasks have terminated, workerCount is zero, the thread transitioning to state TIDYING
          will run the terminated() hook method
TERMINATED: terminated() has completed
